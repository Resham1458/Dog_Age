Objective:
    The objective of the project is to find out the respective dog’s year from a dog’s age in human years, using a Python Programming         Language.

Task: 
    The program should ask the user the age of his/her dog in human years.
    The program then should be able to convert that age into dog’s year.
    Outputs the age in dog’s year

Assumption: 
    7 human years = 1 dog’s year

Process: 
    User is asked to enter the dog’s age in human years.
    If the user inputs a negative number, the program displays a message saying "Age must be positive number."
    When user enters a positive number, the program converts that number into dog’s year and outputs the dog’s year.
